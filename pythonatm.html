        <h2>Written Response:</h2>
       <p class="paragraph">For my python project, my group and I created an ATM machine. During the process of developing this ATM, we encountered some problems with our code. For example, one problem that came about was the functioning of our while loops. The while loops would keep looping, so we had to fix the loops by implementing if statements. A second problem that came about was the if statements. We realized that we had two else statements, which did not work well. We shifted the code around adding elif statements, which helped the porgram run smoother. Something that I developed on my own was the account we have stored within the ATM. Overall, we had many problems that we were able to overcome and develop our ATM machine. </p>
