<h1 class="header">About Me</h1>

<p class="paragraph2">A few of my main personal career goals are to be involved in business and jewelry. I do not want to work for anybody. I plan to achieve these goals by going to a great college and learning from my family aswell.
I want to be involved in this career because of my family and their business. I also want to bring new ideas and know how to run a business, so following this career path will help me do that.
</p>
<br>
<p class="paragraph2">I am a very self-motivated person. I motivate myself to good things in school and to take difficult classes. I feel being self-motivated also helps me get good grades. Being self-motivated will help in my career choice because you have to be confident in what you do and need to always want to get better to develop a better business.
I am also a responsible person. I am responsible in many things such as school work, studying when I need to, and also in my everyday life.</p>
<br>
<p class="paragraph2">One of my major accomplishments so far in high school was to have all A's and one B. I am also taking CSP to learn and hopefully get decent at coding. I have been taking a good amount of difficult classes in high school. By taking these classes I have learned that I can work hard and be able to achieve whatever I want if I work for it. I have helped my family work before, and it was a lot more work than I thought it would be. These experiences have also taught me that I need to work hard in order to achieve certain goals.</p>
<br>
<p class="paragraph2">Overall, I am still growing to achieve my goals in school and in my future. Thank you for reading and I hope you have learned a little more about me! Feel free to explore the rest of my website and some of the projects I have created. Also, you can contact me anytime. Thank you!</p>
