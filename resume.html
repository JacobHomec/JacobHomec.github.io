<h2>My Goals</h2>
<p class="paragraph">My career goals are to be involved in business and jewelry.</p>
<h2>Education</h2>
<p class="paragraph">I go to Palm Desert High School, in Palm Desert California. I am currently on my second year of highschool. Some courses I am currently taking are Math 3 Honors and Spanish 2 Honors. One of my biggest college interests is UC Irvine. I want to learn business and possibly take GIA on the side.

<h2>My Work Experience</h2>
<p class="paragraph">Over the summer of 2019, I worked with my family and their jewelry business. I was in charge of measuring and weighing gold chains. Throughout elementary school, I was a boy scout and we volunteered at many places such as homeless shelters.</p>
