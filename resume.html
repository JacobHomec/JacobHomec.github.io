<h2>My Goals</h2>
<p class="paragraph">My career goals are to be involved in business and jewelry.</p>
<h2>Education</h2>
<p class="paragraph">I go to Palm Desert High School, in Palm Desert California. I am currently on my second year of highschool. Some courses I am currently taking are Math 3 Honors and Spanish 2 Honors. One of my biggest college interests is UC Irvine. I want to learn business and possibly take GIA on the side.
</p>
<h2>My Work Experience</h2>
<p class="paragraph">Over the summer of 2019, I worked with my family and their jewelry business. I was in charge of measuring and weighing gold chains. This was a lot of work everyday, and it really changed my perspective on what working really is. Throughout elementary school, I was a boy scout and we volunteered at many places such as homeless shelters.</p>
<h2>My Skills and Achievements</h2>
<p class="paragraph">I have some experience with business and jewelry so far. I help my family with their jewelry business and it educates me on many different aspects of that field. I also learn a lot about of business while I help aswell. Currently I sell shoes/clothes as a hobby that I get moeny from. I have also been to events in different parts of California based on them. These experiences have also and are continuing to help my views and understandings on business grow. In middle school, I recieved a reward for having a 4.0 GPA all three years of school. I also have taken and currently taken many honors classes and one AP class in highschool so far. I have also built two computers and love to game.</p>
