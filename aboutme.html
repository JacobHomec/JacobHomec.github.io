<h1>About Me</h1>
<p class="paragraph">My main personal career goal is to be involved in business and/or jewelry. I plan to achieve these goals by going to a great college and learning from my family aswell.
I want to be involved in this career because of my family and their business. I also want to bring new ideas and know how to run a business, so following this career path will help me do that.
